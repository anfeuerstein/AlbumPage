        <h2> <a href="http://www.adtr.com">A Day To Remember</a></h2>
        <h3>February 2, 2009</h3>
        <p>A Day To Remember's third album brings about an amazing blend of dense Metalcore
            with the more bouncy spring-loaded pop-punk sounds.  This album really shows off
        frontman Jeremy McKinnon's vocal range from heavy metal laden tracks such as 
    "NJ Legion Iced Tea" to softer more pop-punk inspired songs such as "If it Means A Lot To You."</p>
